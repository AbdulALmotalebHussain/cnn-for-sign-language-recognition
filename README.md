# CNN for Sign Language Recognition

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for recognizing sign language gestures. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of sign language gestures, we preprocess the data to suit the needs of a CNN model. The project demonstrates the application of CNNs in interpreting sign language, providing a foundation for creating assistive technologies for individuals with hearing impairments.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Detailed steps to prepare the sign language dataset for training.
- **CNN Model**: Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network model tailored for sign language recognition.
- **Validation**: Techniques and results of model validation, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- **Real-time Recognition**: Integration with a webcam using OpenCV for real-time sign language recognition.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib (Install using `pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy matplotlib`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```
